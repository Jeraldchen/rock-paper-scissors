# rock-paper-scissors
This project is an introduction to programming in javascript where I get to practice the basics of variable declaration, loops, conditonals and functions.

This is a simple rock, paper, scissors game where the user can choose rock, paper or scissors by pressing any of the three buttons and play against the computer. The party that reaches 5 points first wins.
